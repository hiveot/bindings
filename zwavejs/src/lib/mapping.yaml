# ZWaveJS binding with mapping of ValueID to TD property, event or action

# VID mapping is based on CC and further filtered by propertyName

VID:
  *:   # default any CC
    *:    # default any VID
      - ignore: false           # default: do not ignore
      - isAction: false         # default: not an action
      - isEvent: false          # default: not an event
      - isProperty: true        # default: treat as a property
      - isConfig: {writable}    # default: writable properties are configuration
      - type: {propertyName}    # default: use property name as type (subject to rename)

  basic:
    currentValue:
      - rename: "value"         # rename property 'currentValue' to 'value'
      - isEvent: true
    targetValue:
      - ignore: true

  barrier operator:
    *:
      - isAction: {writable}

  # battery CC properties are events
  battery:
    *:
      - isEvent: true

    Any:
      - rename: "switch"          # rename property 'Any' to 'value' and send as event
